# raw_dataset_cleaning
I used a raw datset(retail sales data)  which consists of several mistakes of the customers. I used python pandas to remove the mistakes in the dataset and also python code creates a new cleaned dataset of the raw data
you can save the python code file and the raw dataset in the same folder then it executes and works properly raw dataset is a csv file
